# Don't normalize existing changeset file names

When a new change file is created via `CreateChangeFile`,
its name is generated by converting the summary of the change to all lowercase letters and underscores.
This same normalization was happening when opening an _existing_ change file, which prevented that change file from
being deleted during a `PrepareRelease` step if it didn't match the normalized version
(for example, was created with a different tool or by hand).
This has been fixed.

Fixes #1340
