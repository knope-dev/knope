title: "Why the name and logo?"
---

Knope (pronounced like "nope") is a reference to the character Leslie Knope from the TV show Parks and Recreation. 
She loves doing the hard, tedious work that most people don't like doing, and she's very good at it, just like this tool!

The logo is a binder in reference to Leslie Knope's love of binders. The binder is also analogous to the `knope.toml` file 
which defines all the workflows for your project.
