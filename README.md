A command line tool that happily completes the tasks which most developers find tedious.

## Example: Automating GitHub Actions Release

Got some conventional commits?

```
feat: A spicy feature
fix: Some sauce
```

And some changesets?

Do you want to release this by hand? Knope! Here's a GitHub Actions workflow:

```yaml
name: Drop a new version

on: workflow_dispatch

jobs:
  create-release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
          token: ${{ secrets.PAT }}
      - uses: knope-dev/action@v1 # Install Knope
        with:
          version: 0.18.5
      - run: knope release
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.PAT }}
```

You get a GitHub release and a changelog, picking the [semantic version] based on the combination of [conventional commits] and [changesets].
