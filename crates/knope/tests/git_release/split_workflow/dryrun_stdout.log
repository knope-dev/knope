Loading package
Cargo.toml has version 1.1.0
Looking for Git tags matching package name.
Searching for last package tag to determine if there's a release to release
Last tag is 1.0.0
Release has previously been prepared without a changelog, will create a release with no notes.
Would create Git tag v1.1.0
