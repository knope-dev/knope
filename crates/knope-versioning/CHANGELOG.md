## 0.5.0 (2025-08-10)

### Breaking Changes

- `Change` now has `summary` and `details` instead of `description`
- `Change` no longer impls `From<changesets::PackageChange>`
- `ChangeSource` variants are now a struct style instead of tuple style
- `Package::get_changes` has a completely different signature, to support providing commit info for each change
- `ReleaseNotes` has new, required `change_templates` field
- Swapped `From<ChangeType>` to `From<&ChangeType>` for `changesets::ChangeType`

#### `ReleaseNotes::create_release` is no longer `pub`

This wasn't being used by Knope or Knope Bot directly, and non-pub functions give better lints.
If anyone is using this crate and needed that function, let me know!

### Features

- `impl Default for ReleaseNotes`

## 0.4.2 (2025-06-23)

### Features

#### Add support for dependencies in `package.json` files

You can now update the `dependencies` and `devDependencies` of a `package.json` like this:

```toml
[package]
versioned_files = [
  # Update @my/package-name in dependencies and devDependencies whenever this package version updates
  { path = "package.json", dependency = "@my/package-name" }
]
```

#### Support `package-lock.json` files

`package-lock.json` files are [now supported](https://knope.tech/reference/config-file/packages/#package-lockjson)
as `versioned_files` both for single packages and dependencies (in monorepos).

These files will be auto-detected and updated if using the default (no `[package]` or `[packages]`) config, so
this is a breaking change for those users.

### Fixes

#### Fix multiple versioned files with same path

Previously, if you referenced the same file multiple times in versioned_files, only the first instance would apply.
Now, if you reference the same path multiple times, each instance will be processed sequentially.

Consider a mono-repo where every package should be versioned in lockstep:

```toml
[package]
versioned_files = [
  "package.json",
  { path = "package.json", dependency = "aDependency" },  # Before this fix, this was ignored
  "aDependency/package.json"
]
```

This use-case is now supported!

## 0.3.3 (2025-03-12)

### Features

#### Add versioning support for `gleam.toml` files

##1352 by @dbanty

Closes #1350

## 0.3.2 (2025-03-08)

### Features

#### Add basic support for versioning of `pom.xml` files

`pom.xml` must contain a `<version>` field in the `<project>` section.
Dependencies and multi-module projects are not yet supported.

### Fixes

#### Don't normalize existing changeset file names

When a new change file is created via `CreateChangeFile`,
its name is generated by converting the summary of the change to all lowercase letters and underscores.
This same normalization was happening when opening an _existing_ change file, which prevented that change file from
being deleted during a `PrepareRelease` step if it didn't match the normalized version
(for example, was created with a different tool or by hand).
This has been fixed.

Fixes #1340
