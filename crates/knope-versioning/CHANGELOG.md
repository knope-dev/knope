## 0.3.3 (2025-03-12)

### Features

##1352 by @dbanty

Closes #1350

## 0.3.2 (2025-03-08)

### Features

#### Add basic support for versioning of `pom.xml` files

`pom.xml` must contain a `<version>` field in the `<project>` section.
Dependencies and multi-module projects are not yet supported.

### Fixes

#### Don't normalize existing changeset file names

When a new change file is created via `CreateChangeFile`,
its name is generated by converting the summary of the change to all lowercase letters and underscores.
This same normalization was happening when opening an _existing_ change file, which prevented that change file from
being deleted during a `PrepareRelease` step if it didn't match the normalized version
(for example, was created with a different tool or by hand).
This has been fixed.

Fixes #1340
