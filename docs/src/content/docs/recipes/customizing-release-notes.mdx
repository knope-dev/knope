title: Customizing release notes
---

import { Badge } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

You don't have to settle for the built-in changelog formatting,
there are a number of ways to customize generated changelogs.
Each top-level heading on this page is a different way to customize.
You can skip right to the most interesting one for you.

Before starting, here is how a [version in a changelog](/reference/concepts/changelog#versions) looks by default:

```markdown
## 2.0.0 (2023-10-31)

### Breaking changes

- Simple breaking change

#### Complex breaking change

Some details about that change

### Features

- Simple feature

#### A new feature

Some details about that feature

### Fixes

- Simple fix

#### A bug fix

Some details about that fix

### Notes

- Simple note

#### A note

Some details about that note
```

This is using the [default sections](/reference/concepts/release-notes#sections) at the recommended [header level](#changing-the-header-level) and the
default [change templates](#customizing-change-entries). Knope only includes sections containing at least one change.

## Adding more sections

You can use the `extra_changelog_sections` config option to add extra sections to a changelog.
This is per-package, so if you have more than one package, you'll need to customize each changelog.

```toml title="knope.toml"
[package]
extra_changelog_sections = [
    { name = "Security", footers = ["Security"], types = ["sec"] }
]
```

You can add as many sections as you want, they will appear in order _after_ the built-in sections.
Each section can be added to from any number of [conventional commit footers](/reference/concepts/conventional-commits/#footers) and [changeset types](https://github.com/knope-dev/changesets?tab=readme-ov-file#change-type).
The semantic version impact of any custom changes is `patch`.

## Overriding built-in sections

The built-in sections, as described at the top of this page, can be overridden.

:::caution
The default order is recommended, as it organizes changes from most-important (for consumers) to least-important.
Overridden sections always appear after non-overridden sections in the order they're defined.
So, if you're going to override any of the first three sections,
it's recommended you also override any sections that should appear below them.
:::

Here's some config that would override all the built-in sections,
_only_ changing their name (not their order or sources):

```toml title="knope.toml"
[package]
extra_changelog_sections = [
    { types = ["major"], name = "❗️Breaking ❗" },
    { types = ["minor"], name = "🚀 Features" },
    { types = ["patch"], name = "🐛 Fixes" },
    { footers = ["Changelog-Note"], name = "📝 Notes" },
]
```

## Adding to `Notes` from more sources

The built-in `Notes` section comes from any [conventional commit footers](/reference/concepts/conventional-commits#footers) named `Changelog-Note`.
You can override this section in the config file to add more sources:

```toml title="knope.toml"
[package]
extra_changelog_sections = [
    { name = "Notes", footers = ["Changelog-Note"], types = ["note"] }
]
```

Now, when running a [`CreateChangeFile`](/reference/config-file/steps/create-change-file/) step (for example, with `knope document-change`), the `note` type will be available:

```text
? What type of change is this?
  major
  minor
  patch
> note
[↑↓ to move, enter to select, type to filter]
```

## Customizing change entries <Badge text="Knope 0.21.1+" variant="tip" />

By default, there are two ways a change might appear in release notes, depending on whether the change is [simple or complex](/reference/concepts/release-notes#simple-vs-complex-changes).
You can add custom templates for rendering changes [to your config file](/reference/config-file/release-notes):

```toml
[release_notes]
change_templates = [
    "* $summary by $commit_author_name ($commit_hash)",
    "### $summary\n\n$details",
    "### $summary",
]
```

Knope will attempt to apply any templates in order from top to bottom, skipping ones where a variable isn't relevant.
So in the above example:

1. If the change was a conventional commit, and therefore as `$commit_author_name` and `$commit_hash`, use the first template.
2. If the change is complex (a change file with content below the header), and therefore has `$details`, use the second template.
3. Use the third template (all changes have a `$summary`).

:::note

You can find all the available variables for `change_templates` in [the config reference](/reference/config-file/release-notes).

:::

If Knope gets to the end of the list and hasn't found a applicable template, it uses defaults which are equivalent to:

```toml
[release_notes]
change_templates = [
    "### $summary\n\n$details",
    "- $summary",
]
```

:::note

The order of the templates _only_ determines their precedence, not the order that changes appear in a section.
You currently can't customize the order of changes in a section.

:::

## Changing the header level

:::note

This affects [changelogs][changelog] only, not releases on [forges][forge].

:::

By default, the heading of a version is `##`, each section is `###`, and each [complex change](/reference/concepts/release-notes/#simple-vs-complex-changes) is `####`.
The _relative_ level of those sections is always the same,
but you can change each version to be a top-level heading (`#`)
by modifying the last version in the changelog to be that level.
Knope looks for the previous version to decide the level of the next version.

:::caution
Knope expects versions in the changelog to look similar to how it would generate them,
specifically it _must_ start with a valid [semantic version](/reference/concepts/semantic-versioning).
If you have a different format for your pre-existing headers, you'll need to update the _latest_ version to Knope's format.
