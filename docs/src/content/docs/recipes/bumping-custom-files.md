title: Versioning unsupported files
---

Want to bump the version of a file that isn't [natively supported](/reference/config-file/packages#versioned_files)?
[Request it as a feature] and, in the meantime, you can write a script to manually bump that file with the version
produced by [`BumpVersion`] or [`PrepareRelease`] using a [`Command`] step, like this:

```toml
[package]
versioned_files = []  # With no versioned_files, the version will be determined via Git tag
changelog = "CHANGELOG.md"

[[workflows]]
name = "release"

[[workflows.steps]]
type = "PrepareRelease"

[[workflows.steps]]
type = "Command"
command = "my-command-which-bumps-a-custom-file-with $version"
```

:::caution
The `Version` variable in the [`Command`] step, including the default `$version`, can't be used when multiple packages are defined.
This is a temporary limitationâ€”if you have a specific use case for this, please [file an issue][request it as a feature].
