title: GitHub Actions workflow dispatch
---

With this recipe, you can trigger the entire release process manually
by either clicking a button in GitHub Actions or by using the GitHub CLI.
Once that trigger occurs:

1. Knope calculates the new version of the project (using [`PrepareRelease`]) and updates versioned files and changelogs.
2. Knope commits the changes back to the branch and pushes.
3. GitHub Actions builds assets from the new commit.
4. Knope creates a release on GitHub with the new version, changelog, and assets.

:::hint
You should also check out the [Pull Request Releases](/recipes/1-preview-releases-with-pull-requests) recipe,
which is similar, but includes release previews via pull requests.
:::

:::note
All the examples in this recipe are for a project with a single Rust binary to releaseâ€”
you'll need to adapt some specifics to your use-case.

Here's the GitHub Actions workflow file:

```

There are three jobs here:

1. `prepare-release` runs the `prepare-release` Knope workflow and saves the new commit as an output for use later.
2. `build-artifacts` builds the assets for the release from the new commit that `prepare-release` created.
3. `release` runs the `release` Knope workflow which creates the GitHub Release.

Throughout, there's use of a `${{ secrets.PAT }}`, this is a GitHub Token with write permissions to "contents" which
must be stored in GitHub Actions secrets.
For the minimum-possible required privileges,
you should [create a fine-grained access token] with read/write to "contents" for only this repo.

Here's a Knope config which enables this GitHub workflow to work:

```toml
[package]
versioned_files = ["Cargo.toml", "Cargo.lock"]
changelog = "CHANGELOG.md"
assets = "artifacts/*"

[[workflows]]
name = "prepare-release"

[[workflows.steps]]
type = "PrepareRelease"

[[workflows.steps]]
type = "Command"
command = "git commit -m \"chore: prepare release $version\""

[[workflows.steps]]
type = "Command"
command = "git push"

[workflows.steps.variables]
"$version" = "Version"

[[workflows]]
name = "release"

[[workflows.steps]]
type = "Release"

[[workflows]]
name = "document-change"

[[workflows.steps]]
type = "CreateChangeFile"

[github]
owner = "knope-dev"
repo = "knope"
```

There's a single `[package]`, but this pattern should also work for multi-package setups, just make sure all your assets are ready at the same time.
In this case, there are two versioned files (`Cargo.toml` and `Cargo.lock`), the changelog (`CHANGELOG.md`), and all
assets (four, in the example GitHub workflow).

There are two relevant workflows here, the third (`document-change`) is for creating changesets during development. `prepare-release` starts by running the [`PrepareRelease`] step, which does the work of updating `Cargo.toml`, `Cargo.lock`, and `CHANGELOG.md` based
on any conventional commits or changesets.
Knope then runs a command to commit the changes and push them back to the current branch (note that using the `Version` variable isn't supported for multi-package setups at this time). Once this workflow runs, the project is ready to build assets.

When ready, GitHub Actions calls into the `release` workflow which runs a single step: [`Release`].
This will compare the latest stable tagged release to the version in `Cargo.toml` (or any other `versioned_files`)
and create releases as needed by parsing the contents of `CHANGELOG.md` for the release's body.
The release is initially created as a draft, then Knope uploads assets before publishing the release
(so your subscribers won't be notified until it's ready).
