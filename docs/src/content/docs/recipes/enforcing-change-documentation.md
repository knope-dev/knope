title: Enforce change documentation
---

Knope has a GitHub App that enforces that changes are documented before allowing a pull request to be merged.

You can install the bot from [GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace/knope-bot).
Only install it for the repositories you want to enforce documentation on (as it will do this by default).
