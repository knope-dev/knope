## Knope can...

<CardGrid stagger>
  <Card title="Write changelogs for you" icon="pen">
    No more reading commit messages every time you release. Document important
    changes as you make them and let Knope handle the rest.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Create GitHub PRs and Releases" icon="github">
    Keep an update-to-date preview of the next version in a pull request. Merge
    it to release.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Update your semantic version" icon="rocket">
    Describe what changed with changesets and conventional commits. Knope
    organizes those changes and picks the correct version for you.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Fit your workflow" icon="puzzle">
    You don't _need_ to customize or configure anything, but you _can_ tune
    Knope to be perfect for your project.
