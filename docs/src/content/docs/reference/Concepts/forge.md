A forge is a fully featured Git server with a web interface, like GitHub, Gitea or GitLab.
Currently, Knope can interact with the following forges:

- [Gitea]
- [GitHub]

:::caution
If you configure more than one forge, Knope will assume that you wish to push to all of them.
Keep that in mind when writing your configuration.

[GitHub]: /reference/config-file/github
