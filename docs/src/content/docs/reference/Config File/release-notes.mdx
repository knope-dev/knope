import { Badge } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

The `[release_notes]` section of `knope.toml` customizes how Knope renders [release notes], both as
[changelogs][changelog] and [forge] releases.

## `change_templates` <Badge text="Knope 0.21.1+" variant="tip" />

An array of templates to customize each [change] entry.

```toml title="knope.toml"
[release_notes]
change_templates = [
    "* $summary by $commit_author_name ($commit_hash)",
]
```

Different variables are available for different types of [changes][change].
Knope will use the first template containing _only_ valid variables for a given change.
If no template is applicable, Knope will use a default template.
The default templates are equivalent to `["### $summary\n\n$details", "- $summary"]`, using a small Markdown section for
complex changes and a single bullet for simple changes.

### Variables

#### `$summary`

Every change has a summary. It's one of:

1. The title line (first non-empty line after the frontmatter, typically starting with a `#`) of a [change file]
2. Everything after the `:` on the first line of [conventional commits]
3. Everything after the `:` in a [conventional commit footer]

#### `$details`

Only a [change file] can have details, they're any content after the title line.

#### `$commit_author_name`

The name of the author of a [conventional commits] or the commit which introduced a [change file].

Knope will skip templates containing this variable for [change file]s that aren't committed.

#### `$commit_hash`

The [short hash](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Revision-Selection) of a [conventional commit] of the commit that introduced a [change file].

Knope will skip templates containing this variable for [change file]s that aren't committed.

#### `$commit_author_login`

The GitHub username of the author of a [conventional commits] or the commit which introduced a [change file].

This variable requires [`[github]`](/reference/config-file/github) to be configured. Knope will fetch the
associated pull request from the GitHub API to determine the author's login.
Knope will skip templates containing this variable when the login isn't available.

:::note

Using this variable (or `$pr_number`) in any template will cause Knope to make GitHub API calls during
`PrepareRelease`, which requires a `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable or a stored token.
If you don't use these variables, no API calls are made.

:::

#### `$pr_number`

The pull request number that introduced a [conventional commit] or a [change file].

This variable requires [`[github]`](/reference/config-file/github) to be configured. Knope will look up the
pull request associated with each commit via the GitHub API.
Knope will skip templates containing this variable when no associated pull request is found.
