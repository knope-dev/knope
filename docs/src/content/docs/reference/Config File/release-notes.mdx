title: Release Notes

import { Badge } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

The `[release_notes]` section of `knope.toml` customizes how Knope renders [release notes], both as
[changelogs][changelog] and [forge] releases.

## `change_templates` <Badge text="Knope 0.21.1+" variant="tip" />

An array of templates to customize each [change] entry.

:::

```toml title="knope.toml"
[release_notes]
change_templates = [
    "* $summary by $commit_author_name ($commit_hash)",
]
```

Different variables are available for different types of [changes][change].
Knope will use the first template containing _only_ valid variables for a given change.
If no template is applicable, Knope will use a default template.
The default templates are equivalent to `["### $summary\n\n$details", "- $summary"]`, using a small Markdown section for
complex changes and a single bullet for simple changes.

### Variables

#### `$summary`

Every change has a summary. It's one of:

1. The title line (first non-empty line after the frontmatter, typically starting with a `#`) of a [change file]
2. Everything after the `:` on the first line of [conventional commits]
3. Everything after the `:` in a [conventional commit footer]

#### `$details`

Only a [change file] can have details, they're any content after the title line.

#### `$commit_author_name`

The name of the author of a [conventional commits] or the commit which introduced a [change file].

If a [change file] hasn't been committed, templates containing this variable will be skipped.

#### `$commit_hash`

The [short hash](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Revision-Selection) of a [conventional commit] of the commit that introduced a [change file].

If a [change file] hasn't been committed, templates containing this variable will be skipped.
