title: CreatePullRequest
---

Create a pull request on every configured forge from the current branch to a specified branch. If a pull request for those already exists, this step will overwrite the title and body of the existing pull request.

:::caution
If you configure more than one forge, Knope will assume that you wish to create a PR on all of them.
Keep that in mind, when writing your configuration.
:::

## Prerequisites

To use the `CreatePullRequest` step, you must configure a forge first. See [configuring a Forge] for more information.

## Parameters

### `base`

The branch that the pull request should target. This is a **required** parameter.

### `title.template`

A template string for the title of the pull request. This is a **required** parameter.

### `title.variables`

An optional map of variables to use in the title template. You can omit this to use [the defaults].

### `body.template`

A template string for the body of the pull request. This is **required**.

### `body.variables`

An optional map of [variables] to use in the body template. You can omit this to use [the defaults].

## Example

An example workflow which creates a pull request from the current branch to `main`.
This uses the current version of the package as the title and the changelog entry for the current version as the body:

```toml
[[workflows]]
name = "create-release-pull-request"

[[workflows.steps]]
type = "CreatePullRequest"
base = "main"

[workflows.steps.title]
template = "chore: Release {version}"
variables = { "{version}" = "Version" }

[workflows.steps.body]
template = "Merging this PR will release the following:\n\n{changelog}"
variables = { "{changelog}" = "ChangelogEntry" }
```

:::note

`variables` wouldn't be necessary if the templates used `$version` and `$changelog` instead of `{version}` and `{changelog}`.
