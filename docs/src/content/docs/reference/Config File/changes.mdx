This top-level section controls how Knope processes changes to your project.

## `ignore_conventional_commits` <Badge text="Knope 0.23.0+" variant="tip" />

When set to `true`, Knope will only consider [Changesets] when determining version bumps and changelog entries, ignoring [Conventional Commits].

```toml title="knope.toml"
[changes]
ignore_conventional_commits = true

[package]
versioned_files = ["Cargo.toml"]
changelog = "CHANGELOG.md"
```

:::note
This replaces the deprecated `ignore_conventional_commits` option on the [`PrepareRelease` step].
To migrate from the old step-level setting to this top-level setting, run `knope --upgrade`.
