title: "Releasing basic projects"
description: Learn how to document changes, update the changelog, and bump package versions
---

This tutorial will take you step by step through the process of:

1. Documenting changes to a package
2. Adding those changes to a changelog
3. Updating version numbers
4. Creating releases on GitHub

:::note

This tutorial creates a new Git repository with a single package.
The [monorepo tutorial](/tutorials/releasing-multiple-packages) covers automating releases for multiple packages in a single Git repository.

:::

## Prerequisites

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/): The `git` CLI must be available in your terminal.
  It's helpful if you know the basics of commits and tags.
- A text editor: for editing Markdown and JSON files. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a good free choice.
- Familiarity with a command line terminal, like "Terminal" on macOS or "PowerShell" Windows
- A [GitHub](https://github.com) account (you can use an alternative, but the results will be different)
- [Install Knope](/installation)

## Creating a project

Create a new empty directory wherever you like and open it in your terminal.

```sh
mkdir knope-tutorial  # create a new directory
cd knope-tutorial     # change into the new directory
```

Initialize a Git repository:

```sh
git init
```

Now open the directory in your text editor and create two files:

```md title="CHANGELOG.md"
# Changelog

This is where the changes in each release are documented.
```

```json title="package.json"
{
  "name": "pizza-builder",
  "version": "1.0.0"
}
```

This is simulating a JavaScript package—in a real package you'd have a lot more info in your `package.json` file,
but `version` is all that Knope needs.
This package is starting at version `1.0.0`,
as you make changes, the version will increase depending on the type of change.

:::note
Knope supports [many package formats for many languages](/reference/Config File/packages#versioned_files).
:::

Knope needs a GitHub repository to publish releases. You can create one with the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/).

```sh
gh repo create --private knope-tutorial --source .
```

## Little changes

Start by documenting a small change using a [conventional commit].

```sh
git commit --allow-empty -m "fix: No longer crashes when you add pineapple"
```

You've just documented a bug fix using a commit message!

:::note
In the real world, this commit would also include the relevant code changes.
:::

Knope can give a preview of the next release:

```sh
knope release --dry-run
```

<details>
    <summary>Example output from Knope</summary>

```text
Would add the following to package.json: 1.0.1
Would add the following to CHANGELOG.md:
## 1.0.1 (2023-11-01)

### Fixes

#### No longer crashes when you add pineapple

Would add files to git:
package.json
CHANGELOG.md
Would run git commit -m "chore: prepare release 1.0.1" && git push
Would create a release on GitHub with name 1.0.1 (2023-11-01) and tag v1.0.1 and body:

## Fixes

### No longer crashes when you add pineapple
```

</details>

:::tip
You can use that `--dry-run` flag anywhere in Knope to see what _would_ happen without actually doing it.
:::

According to that output, Knope will:

1. Set the version of the package in `package.json` to `1.0.1`
2. Add a new section to `CHANGELOG.md` with the documented changes
3. Commit those changes to Git and push to the remote repo
4. Create a new release on GitHub

Time to release it for real!

## Creating a release

Running the `release` workflow again without the `--dry-run` causes Knope to do everything it promised to.

:::caution
The next step will save GitHub credentials to a file on your computer.
If you don't want that, you can instead set the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable to the token.
:::

```sh
knope release
```

```
? No GitHub token found, generate one from https://github.com/settings/tokens with `repo` permissions and input here
```

Knope wants to create that GitHub release, but it needs access to GitHub!
Go ahead and generate a token with the link it provided, then paste it into your terminal.

:::note
Knope will write this token to a file to store for later use (where depends on your operating system).
If you don't want to store the token, you can set the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable instead.
:::

Now that the workflow has complete, the `package.json` has the new version number:

```json title="package.json" {3}
{
  "name": "pizza-builder",
  "version": "1.0.1"
}
```

The `CHANGELOG.md` has the message from the commit:

```md title="CHANGELOG.md" {5-9}
# Changelog

This is where the changes in each release are documented.

## 1.0.1 (2023-11-01)

### Fixes

#### No longer crashes when you add pineapple
```

And that same content is in a new GitHub release:

```sh
gh release view --web
```

![GitHub release](./release_1.0.1.png)

## More complex changes

[Conventional commits] are great for simple changes, you just start your commit with `fix: ` or `feat: `.
For changes that take more than a few words to describe, though, [changesets] are a better fit:

```sh
knope document-change
```

You'll get a choice of the _type_ of change.
The terms are from [semantic versioning], so `minor` is what you'll want for a new feature:

```
? What type of change is this?
  major
> minor
  patch
[↑↓ to move, enter to select, type to filter]
```

After selecting `minor` with the enter key, you can summarize the new feature:

```
> What type of change is this? minor
? What is a short summary of this change? Add calzones
[This will be used as a header in the changelog]
```

This created a new Markdown file which you can fill in with more details:

```md title=".changeset/add_calzones.md" ins={6-9}
---
default: minor
---

# Add calzones

In addition to building Pizzas, you can now build calzones! Just use the new `--calzone` option!

> Pizza? Never heard of it. That's what people will be saying in 20 years, because pizza is old news. Pizza is your grandfather's calzone.
```

You can also add a conventional commit into the same release:

```sh
git commit --allow-empty -m 'feat: Added the `olives` topping'
```

A dry run will explain what Knope will do:

```sh
knope release --dry-run
```

<details>
    <summary>Example output from Knope</summary>

```text {16-18,37-39}
Would delete: .changeset/add_calzones.md
Would add the following to package.json: 1.1.0
Would add the following to CHANGELOG.md:

```

</details>

Uh oh, Knope is including the fix from the _last_ version!
That's because Knope uses Git tags to figure out which conventional commits to include in a release.
The release is on GitHub, but not in the local file system! You can fix that by pulling the tags:

```sh
git pull --tags
knope release --dry-run
```

<details>

```

Much better!
Now that Knope knows _when_ `1.0.1` was, it can ignore the changes from that release.
Time to create this release for real:

```sh
knope release
gh release view --web
```

![GitHub release](./release_1.1.0.png)

This illustrates one of the big advantages to changesets,
you can write as much Markdown content as you need to describe a change.
There could be code snippets, screenshots, even collapsible sections!

## Finishing up

You've done it!
You documented both simple changes (with conventional commits)
and complex changes (with changesets).
Then, you released them by updating the changelog, bumping the version,
and creating a GitHub release, all with a single command!

You already have the basic skills necessary to start speeding up your release processes,
but you can take it a step further by [releasing in GitHub Actions](/recipes/1-preview-releases-with-pull-requests).

:::tip
Don't forget to clean up your GitHub repository when you're done:

```sh
gh repo delete knope-tutorial
```
